<img src="frontend/public/fortune_couple.PNG" width="300"/>

The [fortune couple app](http://fortune-couple.herokuapp.com/#/), inspired by fortune cookies, is a compatibilty app that generates a fortune base on two users zodiacs, common interests, and their perspective on marriage/children. Similar to actual fortune cookies, the fortunes this app generates are short prophecies that should not be taken too seriously. They are meant to make you think or, even better, chuckle. 

## Code Snippets
The code that makes the fortune couple app a success comes from the calculations
happening under the hood. Here are a few examples of the clean code that powers
this app:
